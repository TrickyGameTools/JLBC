# JCR Lua Compile & Bundle

JLCB is nothing more but a quick utility which allows me to quickly compile Lua scripts and bundle their bytecode files (which JLCB will call .lbc or Lua Byte Code) into a JCR6 file.


This program is experimental, but may be used as a core for a new game engine that could replace Apollo which as a few flaws. Long compilation times of Neil/Lua scripts being one of them (actually the one that annoyed me most).
This new engine is not yet certain, but JLCB was a test to see what my possibilities are here.


JLCB does the actual compilation and bundling, while JLCB_Test was merely a test utility which had to show me if everything actually worked the way it should.
